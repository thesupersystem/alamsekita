Poly-species design is a methodology that approaches design through Posthumanist principles developed by Donna Harraway and Rosi Braidotti. This design methodological approach intends to transform human-centered environments into poly-species environments thus, encouraging the co-existence between humans and their non-human counterparts.
This design methodology ensures the inclusivity of non-human stakeholders during all stages of development.
